# Anime-Reccomender
## Project Description:
This is a project I made. It involves the use of an API, taken from [AniList](https://anilist.co/) that uses GraphQL rather than normal REST API. It provides personalised anime reccomendations and explores random anime picks for endless entertainment.

## Features:
- Fetches anime recomendations based on user search.
- Randomised anime section for discovering new shows.
- User-friendly interface for browsing anime details.

## Technologies used:

- ![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-0F172A?&logo=tailwindcss)

## API Integration:
I used the AniList GraphQL API to provide an interactive and personalised anime recommendation experience. This is also the same for the top rated anime and the randomised anime search.

## Future Enchancements:
For future updates, I want to allow users to create an account, with user authentication, so that they can save their watchlists, or add a section that when clicked, automatically saves it on the AniList account. Also to add a filtering option for genres, ratings and more options.
